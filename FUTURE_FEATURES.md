## Video Editor (Temporarily Removed)

### Overview
A comprehensive video editing interface was built with advanced features including AI-assisted editing, timeline management, and export functionality. This feature has been temporarily removed from the navigation to focus on core content creation features, but all components remain intact for future implementation.

### Components Built

#### Core Editor Components
- **`Editor.tsx`** - Main editor page with dual-mode functionality
- **`EditorHeader.tsx`** - Header with save/export actions
- **`EditorVideoSection.tsx`** - Shared video editing interface
- **`AssignedTaskMode.tsx`** - Template-based editing mode
- **`FreeEditMode.tsx`** - Freeform editing mode

#### Video Functionality
- **`VideoPlayer.tsx`** - Custom video player with timeline sync
- **`VideoTimeline.tsx`** - Interactive timeline with drag-and-drop clips
- **`VideoExport.tsx`** - Export interface with format/quality options
- **`ClipLibrary.tsx`** - Media management (read-only component)

#### Features Implemented
1. **Dual Editing Modes**
   - Assigned Task Mode: Template-driven editing with AI requirements
   - Free Edit Mode: Full creative control with manual tools

2. **Timeline Management**
   - Drag-and-drop clip arrangement
   - Visual timeline with playhead
   - Clip trimming and positioning
   - Duration calculations

3. **AI Integration**
   - AI-assisted editing toggle
   - Template requirements integration
   - Smart suggestions (via AISuggestions component)

4. **Playback Controls**
   - Play/pause functionality
   - Seek controls
   - Volume adjustment
   - Timeline scrubbing

5. **Export System**
   - Multiple format support (MP4)
   - Quality options (HD/Standard)
   - Progress tracking simulation
   - Draft saving

6. **File Management**
   - Upload integration with ContentUpload page
   - Session storage for uploaded files
   - Clip library organization

### Technical Implementation

#### State Management
- Centralized clip management with `Clip[]` interface
- Timeline synchronization between player and controls
- Session storage integration for uploaded content

#### Component Architecture
- Modular design with reusable components
- Prop-based communication between components
- Ref-based video player control

#### Data Flow
1. Files uploaded via ContentUpload are stored in session storage
2. Editor loads files and creates clip objects
3. Timeline manages clip positioning and duration
4. Video player renders current clip based on timeline position
5. Export system processes final video configuration

### Next Steps for Implementation

#### Phase 1: Core Video Processing
- Integrate actual video processing library (e.g., FFmpeg.js)
- Implement real file duration detection
- Add proper video format support

#### Phase 2: Advanced Editing
- Real-time video preview during editing
- Audio track management
- Transition effects between clips
- Text overlay functionality

#### Phase 3: AI Features
- Implement actual AI-powered editing suggestions
- Auto-generation of cuts based on content analysis
- Smart template matching

#### Phase 4: Export & Sharing
- Server-side video processing
- Cloud storage integration
- Social media format optimization
- Direct sharing capabilities

### Code Preservation
All video editor components are preserved in the codebase:
- `/src/pages/Editor.tsx`
- `/src/components/Editor*.tsx`
- `/src/components/Video*.tsx`

### Re-enabling Instructions
To re-enable the video editor:
1. Uncomment the Video Editor nav item in `SidebarNav.tsx`
2. Uncomment the editor route in `App.tsx`
3. Import the PlaySquare icon in `SidebarNav.tsx`
4. Test all functionality with uploaded content

### Dependencies Used
- React refs for video player control
- Session storage for file persistence
- Lucide React icons
- Radix UI components
- React Router for navigation

The video editor represents a significant amount of development work and provides a solid foundation for future video editing capabilities within the platform.
